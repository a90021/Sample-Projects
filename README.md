# Sample-projects
Here I have provided some sample projects to showcase my knowledge in data Science. I have used JupyterNotebook to work on these projects. 
One of the projects named Final Assignment(2) is done by me as an assignment in the "Python Project for Data Science" on Coursera.
The project named "restaurant_billing data_vis (1)" is where I have used python libraries matplotlib & seaborn for visualization.
